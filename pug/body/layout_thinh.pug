		h1 Themes built as frameworks
		p Each theme was designed as its own extended version of Bootstrap, built for a specific set of problemsâ€”dashboards, web apps, or marketing pages. To do this we've not only extended many of your favorite parts of Bootstrap, but also introduced dozens of completely new utilities, components, and plugins.
